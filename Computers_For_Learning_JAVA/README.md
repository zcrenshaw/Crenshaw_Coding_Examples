# Computers_For_Learning

PRIMARY LANGUAGE: JAVA

This repository holds some of the assignments and labs that I complete as a part of CMSC209: Computers for Learning (the course description can be found here, down in the course listing: http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/computerscience/)

In short, this course was about pedagological theory, game design, and learning to code games in Java.

In this course I collaborated with my classmate Ni'Gere Epps to create this code.

Final_Game_Design.pdf includes a description of the game created and the learning theory behind it.

FinalProject contains the final project, a space-exploration fraction learning game for 3rd-5th grade students.

The main class in this project is ToSpace
