# Python

This repository has some simple side projects I made in Python. More sophisticated projects can be found at zcrenshaw/SlangTransmission

Uno: A game of uno, only using text and line-by-line instructions at the shell

Guess the Language: Guess the language on the screen!

Zipf: Runs an analysis on a text, and gives the number of ocurrences of each word in the file, along with some statistics about the data set and the process. I used this to test to see if Zipf's Law is true (which I found to be true). The excel file just has some other analysis of the data, graphed.
