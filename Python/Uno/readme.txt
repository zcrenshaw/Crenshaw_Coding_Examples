Hello there!

This is a basic version of the classic game Uno. 

In order to play it, you’re going to have to download IDLE 2.7.3

It’s super easy, and FREE! Just follow the link below:

https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

After that, just open “Uno.py” with IDLE (it should open IDLE automatically, just make sure it is version 2.7.3)! After it’s open, go the toolbar (up top), find the “Run” menu and hit “Run module”, and have fun!
