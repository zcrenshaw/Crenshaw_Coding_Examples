# Intro_to_Computer_Systems

PRIMARY_LANGUAGE: C

This course focused on understanding different levels of a computers function, including binary representation of numbers, machine instructions, architecture, memory caches, OS, threads, and memory management. All programming was done in C, or Assembly. We also learned to use debuggers like gdb. A full description is available at http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/computerscience/ 
under CMSC 15400: Introduction to Computer Systems.

bitmanip: Re-created some common basic functions only using bit-wise manipulators

bomb: Used gdb to work through the assembly for C code to defuse a "bomb"

cache: Created simulations of cache systems of different dimensions. Also optimizing matrix transpositions for speed given certain parameters for how the data is stored in memory.

malloc: Created my own memory allocation system. I created a working explicit free list allocator, with coalescence.
