# Computer Vision

This folder contains some of the work I did for Introduction to Computer Vision (CMSC 25400), taught by Professor Michael Maire. This class covered the following topics:

* Camera Geometry, Image Formation, Color
* Image Processing and Filtering
* Feature and Edge Detection, Matching, Model Fitting
* Stereo, Optical Flow, Structure from Motion
* Segmentation and Grouping
* Deep Learning
* Convolutional Neural Network Architectures
* Object Detection
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Autoregressive Models
* Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning
* Adversarial Examples
* Vision and Language

There are three directories in this folder:

hw1: This is the code for the first homework of the course. In this homework, I implemented 2d convolution, gaussian filtering, nonmax suppression, and canny edge detection from scratch in Python.

hw2: In the second homework, we implemented feature detection and Hough transform in Python. Examples of outputs and a small write up are available in hw2.pdf

ASL_Project: This is the code and writeup for the final project, in which I designed and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Pytorch to recognize and classify the letters of manual alphabet of American Sign Language (ASL). This project obtained 96% accuracy at test time on the given dataset. More details available in ASL_Handshape_Recognition.pdf, and also in the Juypter Notebook file ASL_Alphabet_Recognition_CNN.ipynb.
