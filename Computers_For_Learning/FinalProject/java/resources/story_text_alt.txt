Hello! My name is Dr. Stevens.

@For years I have been trying to get my rocket into space,
but I’ve never figured out how. 

@I’ve just discovered this new type of fuel: Ingenium

@Ingenium is a solid mineral, mined from deep in the Earth. 
When it mixes with water, it creates a HUGE explosion. 

@I think we can use this new material to help get the rocket 
into space. But I need your help!

@I’m still learning how much Ingenium to put into the rocket 
and I need your help to figure it out. 
Do you think you can help me? 

@I’ve tried a lot of combinations of water and ingenium, 
but maybe you can find the best amount of each to put 
into the rocket. 

@Try putting the whole chunk of Ingenium into the rocket. 
To put fuel in, all you have to do is click it.

I’ve already filled the rocket with water to start.

@OK, so now that the Ingenium is in the rocket, 
hit the launch button!

@Whoa, there she goes. Beautiful!

@Alright, so that was a pretty good launch! 
But it’s not good enough to get the rocket into space.
We can do better! 

@Ingenium is pretty heavy, so maybe we can try to put 
less in the rocket to keep it light. 

@Hit the number 2 to split the Ingenium in half.

@Now click on the Ingenium to add half of it to the rocket.

@Nice! OK, hit the launch button.

@This one is going even higher!

@One Frame

@Better! We must be getting closer to the right amount.

@Ok so now try hitting any number 2 through 8 to split up our
fuel into that many pieces.

@Click on the Ingenium to add it to the rocket. 
You can also try adding more than one piece at a time! 

When you’re done, hit the launch button!

@One Frame

@Let's shoot for the stars!

@That amount didn't quite make it to the stars
Press the Reset button in the bottom right corner to retry!

@We made it up to stars!
Now lets try to make it to the moon!

We'll have to change the amount of water to make it there.

@I split the Ingenium into thirds.
Try clicking on the Ingenium to add it to the rocket.

I'd recommend just adding 1/3 because it's so heavy.
Press SPACEBAR when you're ready to add Water.

@Water can also be heavy so I split the water into 1/4ths.

Try clicking on the water until you have 2/4 of it in the rocket.

Then launch the rocket!

@We're so close to reaching the moon!

@One Frame

@We almost made it to the moon! 

@Now try changing the amount
of Ingenium AND Water!

@Let’s start with the Ingenium.
Enter a number 2-8 and add a good amount of Ingenium.
Press SPACEBAR when you're ready to add Water.

@Now let's add Water.
Enter a number 2-8 for the amount of parts you want to split 
the Water into, then click on the Water to put it in the rocket.

Hit Launch when you're ready!

@One Frame

@Let's make it to the moon!

@That amount didn't quite make it to the moon.
Press the Reset button in the bottom right corner to retry!

@Congratulations! We made it to the moon!

You did great! Thank you so much!
