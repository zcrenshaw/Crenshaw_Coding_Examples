To Space and Back

In this game, the player helps a rocket scientist get their rocket into space by experimenting with different fuels and fuel ratios in order to advance humankind’s knowledge of space flight. 

Specs:

Display: 
--Rocket scientist in the corner, with a text box with instructions. 
--Help button (gives hint)
--Settings button (language, soundtrack, toggle text-speech) 
--Reset button 
--Sound toggle button
--Stats box. 
--Image of Rocket on launchpad as main display. 
--Picture of rocket and fuels split into equal parts.
--Colorblind friendly color palette.

Stats: 
--Levels of each fuel type used 
--Current height, 
--Max height, 
--High score, 
--Number of attempts of a level, 


Level 1: Manipulate solid fuel
--Allow user to enter number of pieces to split fuel into (1-10) (If enter out of bounds number, ask again).
--Show the fuel (in shape of circle), split into parts. Allow user to click or enter # of pieces to insert into rocket. Fizzle animation when adding. Simplify fractions (i.e. if split into 8 pieces and insert 2 pieces, show 2/8 = ¼).
--Rocket flying animation (with color gradient / different color at different height as rocket gets closer to space).


Level 5: Manipulate both fuels with constant fractions
--Allow user to control both fuels (one at any given time, however)
--Can only use one fraction type (combining quarters of each fuel)
--Find the correct ratio of both types of fuels to get the best launch


Level 6: Manipulate both fuels with added fraction complexity
--Allow user to control both fuels (one at any given time, however)
--Can change each fraction type (1/2, or 1/3, or 1/4 etc.)
--Find the correct ratio of both types of fuels to get to space
--Congratulations message on entrance into space, try again option
