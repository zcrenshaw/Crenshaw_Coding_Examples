# Computers_For_Learning

PRIMARY LANGUAGE: JAVA

This repository holds some of the assignments and labs that I complete as a part of CMSC209: Computers for Learning (the course description can be found here, down in the course listing: http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/computerscience/)

In short, this course was about pedagological theory, game design, and learning to code games in Java.

In this course I collaborated with my classmate Ni'Gere Epps to create this code.

Lab3 focuses on Inheritance and object hierarchy.

Lab5 is the culmination of all the game engine labs, including movement of animated sprites, sounds, collision detection, and gravity.

Final_Game_Design.pdf includes a description of the game created and the learning theory behind it.

FinalProject contains the final project, a space-exploration fraction learning game for 3rd-5th grade students. The main class in this project is ToSpace. The code in this repository represents our minimum viable product which we created in less than three weeks. Our vision for a full version of the game can be found in Full_Game_Design.pdf
